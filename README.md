# Emotion-Detection-System-
Built a text-based emotion classification model using the Random  Forest algorithm. Used Python libraries like neattext, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn, and joblib for  preprocessing, modeling, visualization, and deployment. The model accurately classified emotions  such as joy, anger, sadness, and fear from text data.
